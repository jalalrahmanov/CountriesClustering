This dataset comprises key socio-economic metrics for multiple countries. It includes crucial factors such as child mortality rates, export and import values, 
healthcare expenditure, income levels, inflation rates, life expectancy, fertility rates, and GDP per capita. These indicators offer a comprehensive view of each 
country's economic and health profile. Analysts can utilize this data to compare and contrast the well-being and economic performance of different nations, aiding in 
policy-making, research, and decision-making processes.
